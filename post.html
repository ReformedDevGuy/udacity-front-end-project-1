        <div class="blog-article">
          <p>
            Last week, we tested our ladders with both CFE223 and Varget. While
            CFE223 provided some stunning velocity numbers (about 50fps more
            than Varget), our accuracy node was quite low - lower than I want
            out of a cartridge like .224 Valkyrie - remember, we are going for a
            1500 yard shot!
          </p>
          <p>
            Thankfully, Varget came through yet again and gave us a pretty
            impressive .6 grain cushion right at our 2750 mark we were trying to
            hit. Today, we are going to explore that accuracy node and find our
            best grouping. I'll be shooting my same gun out of a vice to take
            the "human factor" out of the equation, and we will shoot 5 rounds
            of each load, with a 1 minute cooldown between shots, and a 15
            minute cooldown between loads. We will follow that up with 5 more
            rounds for each load, in reverse order, expanding our cooldown times
            to 5 mintues between shots and 1 hour between loads.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you can see from our results, we tested a mini-ladder from 27.4
            grains all the way to 28 grains. Each load was hand measured in 0.1
            grain incriments, measured with 0.001 grain accuracy. We managed to
            put all shots within half MOA at 100 yards, with our best load of
            27.7 grains shooting an outstanding 0.26 MOA!

          <blockquote>
            The .224 Valkyrie will <em><strong>never</strong></em> become an 
            accurate cartridge at 1500 yards. Mark my words.
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            After hearing several horror stories from fellow shooters about how
            difficult it is to find an accurate load for the .224 Valkyrie, I
            have to say I am astounded by my results from this experiment. Of
            course, we still have to load up some bulk loads with our
            newly-decided charge weight, but as we all know, Varget tends to
            meter consistently, so I have no doubts we will be ringing steel at
            1500 with ease. As always, check back next week to read the range
            report to validate our results. <em><u> Oh - and give me a follow on twitter
            if you don't mind! I am in a competition with a certain youtuber to
